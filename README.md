# Introduction

Blockchain an open, disseminated and decentralized ledger that evidences transactions
involving two parties capably in a confirmable and stable way (Iansiti, Lakhani 2017). In the
above given definition, open means the blockchain is accessible to one and all, disseminated
means that there is no single party control and decentralized means there is no central third
party available, capable means it is fast and more scalable than the conventional technologies,
confirmable means that everyone can check the validity of the informat ion and stable means
that the data is nearly immutable that is it is nearly impossible to change or tamper the data or
information. They verify and validate the identities and chronological events. They guide
every action, transactions that have taken place among individuals, communities,
organizations and nations as well. In this era of digitizat ion, the way maintained and
regulated these type of data must be changed, it must be highly secure and the blockchain is
the solution to this.
In the era of information and communication technology, a farmer's portal has always been
helpful for farmers in many ways, providing ease of use and convenience of information to
the farmers [1]. The Government of India has also taken many initiatives for the same. Few
examples of such portals are Krishijagran.com, farmer.gov.in, agricoop.nic.in and
agriwatch.com etc. Apart from these some E-commerce websites are also available;
fert.nic.in and enam.gov.in etc. The sectors currently using blockchain are shown in Fig.1.Using blockchain technology in the field can make available decentralized computation
and informat ion sharing platform that enables multiple authoritative domains, which do not
trust each other, to cooperate, coordinate and collaborate in a rational decisionmaking
process, a reliable informat ion recording s ystem can be made that can contribute for the
development in the agriculture sector. Since blockchain works like a publicledger, so it can
be utilized to ensure many different aspects
such as [3]:
- Protocols for Commitment: Ensure that every valid transaction from the clients are
committed and included in the blockchain within a finite time.
- Consensus: Ensure that the local copies are consistent and updated.
- Security: The data needs to be tamper -proof. Note that the client may act maliciously or
can be compromised.
- Privacy and Authenticity: The data or transactions belong to various clients; privacy and
authenticity need to be ensured.

Cryptography is a foremost part of the functioning of blockchain technology [4]. Public key
encryption is the root of blockchain wallets and transaction, cryptography hash functions
endow with the trait of immutability and merle trees systematize transactions while enabling
blockchain to be more competent.
Ensuring the above aspects numerous work has been carried out in the field of blockchain.
The presented portal is a contribution over them. It can help to maintain a secure platform for
farmers, where they can trade with the customers electronically. The main object ive of this
study is to record the secure transactions between a seller and a buyer that ensures a contract
between the two. This can help farmers to get a legitimate price for their commodity. The
system also facilitates a single place to record the whole trade transaction.
The availability and accessibility of information are thecrucial points in taking the optimal
decision at right time.Nowadays, advancement of ICT make possible to retrievealmost any
information from the global repository (internet).The information in internet is primarily
maintained in English.So, a large number of people are deprived from the benefit ofinternet
due to technical and English language illiteracy. Thisscenario is very bad in developing
country like India wherenearly 76 % are English illiterate 1 . Moreover, a largepercentage of
the English literate people are also unable to findtheir exact need form the large database of
internet due to lackof proficient knowledge in English. Indian farmers belong tosuch type of
people who are not much sound in both technicalas well as in English.  
So, they are unable to access required information on thefarming life cycle, seed selection,
pesticides, market price etc.from the internet. As a consequence, they are not capable totake
optimal decisions at different stages of farming life cycle,which make huge impact on the
farmer‘s revenue. As a resultsuicide rate has been increased rapidly among the Indian
farming community. According to the reports, those patheticincidents are mainly happened
due to the frustration that theyare unable to pay their debts. These types of situations
createhuge impact on the agriculture sector. Consequently, the focusof new generation is
shifted from farming sector which will bethreatening the near future in India. Our preliminary
studiesreveal that farmers require information at the right stage of thefarming life cycle to
take the right decisions [1]. However,farmers are unable to get this information from internet
due toEnglish language and technical illiteracy. Recently, somewebpages like –Wikipedia,
Indian Railway web page, etc.provide facility of internet access in many users‘ languageother
than English by supporting UTF-8 encoding3. However,it is observed that information is not
so useful to the peoplewho are having poor knowledge on internet and web browsing[2].
Moreover, this type of attempt is meaningless for theilliterate people. A large number of people from the Indianfarmer community are unable to read/write even their ownmother
tongue. So, it is obvious that text based interface,instead of supporting farmer‘s own
language, are not able toprovide the required information. The above mentioned scenario
states that there is arequirement of alternative interaction technique(s). Byconsidering this
fact, Plauché et al. proposed a speech-drivenagricultural query system for Tamil Nadu state
of India [3].However this work does not able to address the scenario oftotal India. Patel et al.
designed an interactive voice applicationfor small-scale farmers in Gujarat, India [4].
However, it dosesnot provide a feature to search for specified content in the forum. There,
user needs to answer the questions sequentiallystarting from the most recent question. User
does not have theoption to skip any question. Moreover, there is no guarantee ofgiving
accurate answer, as the questions are answered by otherusers. Furthermore, this work is also
confined to a particulararea of India. In some recent efforts, expert system based
textanimation has been proposed for diagnosis of most commondiseases occurring in Indian
mango [5]. This work also usespicture based system alongwith the text query for
easierunderstanding of the disease symptoms. Though, it is a goodinitiative for Indian farmer,
but limited to a particular fruit.Another notable work was mobile based multimedia
socialnetworking platform – GappaGoshti for information andadvice exchange, proposed by
Lobo et al. [6]. Ramamritham etal. [7] design an online multilingual, multimedia based
forumfor common man of India. However, those forums and socialnetworking platforms
provide limited number of information ascompared to the internet. Moreover, quality of informationmay not be up to the mark, so illiterate people are unable to getany information
from there. To overcome the limitation ofilliteracy, Samanta et al. [2] proposed and
multimodal interfacefor the Indian common man. However, the iconic module of this work is
not related to the agricultural domain. Other works[8, 9] also highlight the need of a
systematic approach which isrequired to provide the precise information to farming
oppurmmunity. Moreover, not only providing of the information tofarmer, it is also essential
to identify that how the farmers aremotivated toward accessing the information [10].All the
aforementioned observations motivate us to conductin depth research toward making an
interface for Indian farmercommunity, which will be more useable, systematical, andneedful
for them irrespective of language and technicalproficiency. Here, we propose an iconic
interface integratedwith a text to speech (TTS) engine to access the agriculturalinformation
from the internet‘s global repository for Indianfarmer community. Further, we also integrate a
local repositorywith the interface to access urgent information withoutconnecting the internet.

# Literature Survey

**1)Krishi-Bharat i: an interface forIndian farmer
AUTHORS:Ghosh, Soumalya, A. B. Garg, SayanSarcar, PSV S. Sridhar, OjasviMaleyvar, and Raveesh Kapoor**

Rapid growth in the field of ICT helps in basic aspects of mankind like- agriculture,
education, healthcare etc. However, the moderate technical growth of ICT applications
is confined to the community of a limited number of people, who live in digital pockets.
The illiterate people like – farmer, shopkeeper etc. are unable to take the advantages of
the ICT revolution. According to the UNESCO report, population of such people in the
globe is 64% who are unable to use the technology either language or technical barrier.
Moreover the percentage (76%) must be increased in the context of developing
countries. The essential agriculture information is very useful to a farmer for taking
effective decision thus we proposed to develop an iconic interface which is integrated
with speech based interaction in Indian languages. The proposed interface is critically
evaluated with the farmer from different states of India. The evaluation results proved
the effectiveness of the proposed interface.

**2) Krishi Ville—Android based solut ion for Indian agriculture
AUTHORS: Singhal, Manav, KshitijVerma, and Anupam Shukla**

Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in agriculture is an emerging field
focusing on the enhancement of agricultural and rural development in India. It involves
innovative applications using ICT in the rural domain. The advancement of ICT can be
utilized for providing accurate and timely relevant information and services to the
farmers, thereby facilitating an environment for remunerative agriculture. This paper
describes a mobile based application for farmers which would help them in their
farming activities. We propose an android based mobile application - Krishi Ville which
would take care of the updates of the different agricultural commodities, weather
forecast updates, agricultural news updates. The application has been designed taking
indian farming in consideration.

**3)Blockchain based provenance for agricultural products:**

A distributed platform with duplicated and shared bookkeeping
AUTHORS:Hua, Jing, Xiujuan Wang, Mengzhen Kang, Haoyu Wang, and FeiThe provenance (tracing) system of agricultural products is important for ensuring food
safety. However, the stakeholders (growers, farmers, sellers etc.) are numerous and physically dispersed, making it difficult to manage data and information with a centralized approach. As a result, the production procedure remains non-transparent
and trust is hard to build. In this paper, we propose an agricultural provenance system
based on techniques of blockchain, which is featured by decentralization, collective
maintenance, consensus trust and reliable data, in order to solve the trust crisis in
product supply chain. Recorded information includes the management operations
(fertilizing, irrigation, etc.) with certain data structure. Applying blockchain techniques
to the provenance of agricultural product not only widens the application domain of
blockchain, but also supports building a reliable community among different
stakeholders around agriculture production.

**4)Bitcoin and beyond: Atechnical survey on decentralized digital currencies
AUTHORS :Tschorsch, Florian, and BjörnScheuermann**

Besides attracting a billion dollar economy, Bitcoin revolutionized the field of digital
currencies and influenced many adjacent areas. This also induced significant scientific
interest. In this survey, we unroll and structure the manyfold results and research directions.
We start by introducing the Bitcoin protocol and its building blocks. From there we continue
to explore the design space by discussing existing contributions and results. In the process,
we deduce the fundamental structures and insights at the core of the Bitcoin protocol and its
applications. As we show and discuss, many key ideas are likewise applicable in various
other fields, so that their impact reaches far beyond Bitcoin itself.

**5)Towards using ICT to enhance flow of information to aidfarmer sustainability in Sri
Lanka
AUTHORS:L. N. De Silva, J. S. Goonetillake, G. N. Wikramanayake, and A. Ginige**

Farmers need information at all stages of the farming life cycle to make optimal decisions.
The required information includes not only prior knowledge but also real time (dynamic)
information such as market prices and current production levels. Some valuable information
needed by the farmers is produced by government organizations and is available in different
locations in different formats. Although farmer is the most important stakeholder in
agriculture, there has not been much effort to provide the essential information to farmers on
a real time basis. This lack of information is creating many difficulties for farmers as they are
not being able to make the correct decisions relating to their farming activities. Through field
studies we have identified information required by farmers at various stages of the farming cycle and official sources where this information is available. Next we developed an
information flow model that connects various information sources to farmers‘ information
needs. Based on these findings we are now developing a mobile phone based information
system to deliver the required information to farmers in real time.

# SYSTEM ANALYSIS

### EXISTING SYSTEM

In the existing system Farmers, as well as agriculture, are the foundation of life.
Numerous work has been done towards the enhancement of agriculture by developing
technologies that support directly and indirectly to agriculture. A range of research shows that
with the various enhancements in the field of ICT (Information and Communication
Technologies), the farmers are unable to take its advantage and fail to get the proper sale
value for their crops. An interface that benefited the farmers by providing the information
related to the advancement of agriculture techniques. Various technical approaches made in
agriculture, mostly in the field of food and supply chain management. The incorporation of
blockchain technology in agriculture has improved the efficiency of the agriculture supply
chain by reducing the need for verification of data. However, the technology proposed
benefited only the producers in terms of maintaining the accuracy of data for supply.

### DISADVANTAGES OF EXISTING SYSTEM:
- Transaction depends on third party.
- Data stored in local servers it means data may be not secure.
### PROPOSED SYSTEM:

The Proposed Farmer‘s portal is a single gateway through which the e-commerce
activity of crops can be performed. The users‘ experience of the portal can be tailored
according to the individual need. It is a single access point i.e., everything is in a single place,
the only thing needed is single login to approved users.
User: A user can be a buyer or a seller. The seller may be a farmer or a representative of him.
Device: The user can interact through the portal using a computer or a laptop. Interface: To
access the portal, the user needs to register using a sign-up. The registered user logins using the correct credentials. Once the user signs in successfully. The user will have access to the
portal/ interface. A user can view available items that are crops and seeds with their price.
### ADVANTAGES OF PROPOSED SYSTEM:
- The buyer can buy a product and can search for any product according to the
requirement. They can add the product in cart.
- The seller can add a new item, update the existing items, allot and update the price of
the item.
- Purchasing an item is considered as a transaction and is added to the blockchain
accordingly with the correct unique digital signature and timestamp so that any user
cannot deny the activity done by them.

### MODULES
- Sellers
- Buyers
- Admins
- Blockchain

### MODULES DESCRIPTION:
#### Sellers:
The Seller User can register the first. While registering he required a valid user email and
mobile for further communications. Once the user register then admin can activate the
Sellers. Once admin activated the Seller then he/She can login into our system.The seller can
add a new item, update the existing items, allot and update the price of the item. It will
increase the market reach and will also eliminate the middleman.

#### Buyers:

The Seller User can register the first. While registering he required a valid user email and
mobile for further communications. Once the user register then admin can activate the
Sellers. Once admin activated the Seller then he/She can login into our system.The buyer can
buy a product and can search for any product according to the requirement. They can add the
product in cart and delete crop from the cart. After finalizing the product to buy and verifying
the cart user can check out.
#### Admin:
Admin can login with his credentials. Once he login he can activate the sellers and buyers.
The activated user only login in our applications.The admin user can view the all transaction
which is done by buyer user. In the admin frame can view all block chain transaction with its
previous block details and hash values.
#### Blockchain:
Every activity related to introducing a new item andpurchasing an item is considered as a
transaction and isadded to the blockchain accordingly with the correct uniquedigital signature
and timestamp so that any user cannot denythe activity done by them.All these transactions
are visible to everyone in thenetwork. The blockchain is a peer to peer transaction basedon
distributed node systems by means of data encryption, time stamping and consensus. It makes
the portal moresecure at the data as it is immutable, transparent andaccessible to all.

# FEASIBILITY STUDY

The feasibility of the project is analyzed in this phase and business proposal is put
forth with a very general plan for the project and some cost estimates. During system
analysis the feasibility study of the proposed system is to be carried out. This is to ensure
that the proposed system is not a burden to the company. For feasibility analysis, some
understanding of the major requirements for the system is essential.

**Three key considerations involved in the feasibility analysis are,
- ECONOMICAL FEASIBILITY
- TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY
- SOCIAL FEASIBILITY**

### ECONOMICAL FEASIBILITY
This study is carried out to check the economic impact that the system will have on
the organization. The amount of fund that the company can pour into the research and
development of the system is limited. The expenditures must be justified. Thus the developed
system as well within the budget and this was achieved because most of the technologies
used are freely available. Only the customized products had to be purchased.

### TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY
This study is carried out to check the technical feasibility, that is, the technical
requirements of the system. Any system developed must not have a high demand on the
available technical resources. This will lead to high demands on the available technical
resources. This will lead to high demands being placed on the client. The developed system
must have a modest requirement, as only minimal or null changes are required for
implementing this system. 

### SOCIAL FEASIBILITY
The aspect of study is to check the level of acceptance of the system by the user. This
includes the process of training the user to use the system efficiently. The user must not feel
threatened by the system, instead must accept it as a necessity. The level of acceptance by the
users solely depends on the methods that are employed to educate the user about the system
and to make him familiar with it. His level of confidence must be raised so that he is also able
to make some constructive criticism, which is welcomed, as he is the final user of the system.

# SOFTWARE ENVIRONMENT

### PYTHON
Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level
programming language. An interpreted language, Python has a design philosophy that
emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code
blocks rather than curly brackets or keywords), and a syntax that allows programmers to
express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be used in languages such
as C++or Java. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large
scales. Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. CPython, the reference
implementation of Python, is open source software and has a community-based development
model, as do nearly all of its variant implementations. CPython is managed by the nonprofit Python Software Foundation. Python features a dynamic type system and
automatic memory management. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
including object-oriented, imperative, functional and procedural, and has a large and
comprehensive standard library.

### Interactive Mode Programming
Invoking the interpreter without passing a script file as a parameter brings up the following
prompt −

`$ python`

```
Python 2.4.3 (#1, Nov 11 2010, 13:34:43)
[GCC 4.1.2 20080704 (Red Hat 4.1.2-48)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
Type the following text at the Python prompt and press the Enter −
>>> print "Hello, Python!"
```

If you are running new version of Python, then you would need to use print statement with
parenthesis as in print ("Hello, Python!");. However in Python version 2.4.3, this produces
the following result −
```
Hello, Python!
```
### Script Mode Programming
Invoking the interpreter with a script parameter begins execution of the script and continues
until the script is finished. When the script is finished, the interpreter is no longer active.
Let us write a simple Python program in a script. Python files have extension .py. Type the
following source code in a test.py file −
Live Demo
```
print "Hello, Python!"
```
We assume that you have Python interpreter set in PATH variable. Now, try to run this
program as follows −
```
$ python test.py
```
This produces the following result −
```
Hello, Python!
```
Let us try another way to execute a Python script. Here is the modified test.py file −
Live Demo
```
#!/usr/bin/python
print "Hello, Python!"
```
We assume that you have Python interpreter available in /usr/bin directory. Now, try to run
this program as follows −
```
$ chmod +x test.py # This is to make file executable
$./test.py
```
This produces the following result −
```
Hello, Python!
```
### Python Identifiers
A Python identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module or other
object. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_) followed by zero
or more letters, underscores and digits (0 to 9).
Python does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. Python
is a case sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different
identifiers in Python.
Here are naming conventions for Python identifiers −
Class names start with an uppercase letter. All other identifiers start with a lowercase letter.
Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates that the identifier is private.
Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strongly private identifier.
If the identifier also ends with two trailing underscores, the identifier is a language-defined
special name.

### Reserved Words
The following list shows the Python keywords. These are reserved words and you cannot use
them as constant or variable or any other identifier names. All the Python keywords contain
lowercase letters only.

| Keywords  | -       | -       |
|   :---:   |  :---:  |  :---:  |
| and       | exec    | not     |
| assert    | finally | or      |
|  break    | for     | pass    |
|  class    | from    | print   |
|  continue | global  | raise   |
|  def      | if      | return  |
|  del      | import  | try     |
|  elif     | in      | while   |
|  else     | is      | with    |
|  except   | lambda  | yield   |

**Lines and Indentation**
Python provides no braces to indicate blocks of code for class and function definitions or
flow control. Blocks of code are denoted by line indentation, which is rigidly enforced.
The number of spaces in the indentation is variable, but all statements within the block must
be indented the same amount. For example −
